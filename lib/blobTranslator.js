/**
 * This file serves as an example for how to listen to the server using the socket.io api
 * from their node-js library.
 */
// Need the Socket.io client library from npm listed in the package.json
var socket = require('socket.io-client')(8888); // to connect to the live server the address is dev.mirrorworlds.icat.vt.edu
socket.emit('start', {connectionType: 'LISTENER'}); //We are telling the server we will listen for all blobs
/*
 If we wanted to listen for specific camera ids we need to populate a reqCameras field with an array of ids
 Example:
 socket.emit('start', {connectionType: 'LISTENER', reqCameras: [0,1,2]}); //will subscript to cameras 0,1,and 2
 */
/*
 you can also only receive the blobs without the global transformation by adding the local: true field to your spec
 */

/**
 * This will inform the user when the connection to the server occurs to help diagnose between
 * being unable to connect and not recieveing the blobs form the server for some reason

 * so logging them would clutter stdout and lead to a more confusing example.
 * an updateBlob event will be sent when an existing blobs has updated coordinates to notify of those changes.
 */
socket.on('updateBlob', function (blob) {
